\title{Social Network Analysis of NFL Coaches, 1980-2013}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

Coaching in the United States' National Football League is a high stakes
business.  NFL coaches domainate the top paid coaches in U.S. sports
\cite{forbes-pay}.  The best coaches are paid in excess of \$7 million per
year.

The group of NFL coaches is a relatively tight circle.  Head coaches are often
hired from the pool of offensive and defensive coordinators.  

The There is general perception that influential coaches pass on their
knowledge to assistants, who then become successful head coaches themselves.
This is typically associated wiht a particular philosophy, such as the ``west
coast offense'' or the 3-4 defense.  Figure \ref{fig-bill-walsh} shows the
coaching family tree for Bill Walsh, a successful coach from the 1980s.

This report considers a two main questions about NFL coaches who have worked
together.  First, does centrality in the social network align with overall
coaching success?  Second, are there distinct communities in the network,
perhaps aligned with some particular style or philosophy?

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

Data on NFL coaching staffs was gathered from the site
\url{http://www.pro-football-reference.org} by reading the pages and parsing
the listed coaching staff.  For example, this page
\url{http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/2010.htm} lists the
coaches for the 2010 Detroit Lions.  The team page generally lists the head
coach, offensive coordinator, and defensive coordinator.  Only the years
1980-2013 were considered.  The code used to produce this data is available at \cite{scraper}.

\subsection{Network Construction}

The relationship between members of the coaching staff is subject to
interpretation.  Within this data, the coach may be both a coordinator and head
coach.  

For this analysis, I consider two constructions of the social network:
\begin{enumerate}

\item The first model attempts to follow the ``coaching family tree''
perception, and only has directed edges from head coach to coordinator.  This
approach attempts to model the influence of successful coaches through the
success of their assistants.  Edges are between the head coach and the
coordinators; coordinators have no connection to each other.  This model will
be referred to as the \emph{tree} model.  The tree model is used for centrality
measures since this report is looking for the centrality successfull
\emph{head} coaches.  The file is {\tt coaches\_tree.gml}.

\item The second model considers each member of the staff to be connected with
every coach they served with, with increasing weight for each year served.
This approach attempts to identify coaching ``communities'' who may tend serve
together.  This model will be referred to as the \emph{peer} model.  The file
is {\tt coaches\_peer.gml}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Analysis}

Network analysis is done in the R programming language with the {\tt igraph}
package.  The calculations are included in this document using the {\tt knitr}
package.

For centrality measurement, the validation metric is based on alignment with
super-bowl winning coaches since this data was easy to gather.  Due to multiple
career wins, there are only 23 super-bowl winning coaches since 1980.  Ideally
the evaluation should be based on a more continuous metric applicable to all
coaches, such as win percentage, which can be used to calculate correlation.

For community finding, it's difficult to pick a validation metric.  The main
evaluation metric is subjective based on the infographic in figure
\ref{fig-bill-walsh}.

\subsection{Limitations}

There are several important limitations of this anlaysis:

\begin{itemize}

\item Only the head coach and coordinators are considered.  This represents the
only clean data available from \url{http://pro-football-reference.com}.  It
also avoids the complexities resulting from teams having different names for
the various position coaches.  This has the downside of not recognizing cases
where head coaches and coordinators take jobs as position coaches.

\item Only the years 1980-2013 are considered.  The consistent reporting of
offensive and defensive coordinators appears to start around 1980.  This
results in the network being truncated for coaches employed before and after
1980.

\item Coaches are considered to serve the entire year.  In reality, teams may
occasionally fire coaches mid-year, and coaches may take a leave of absence.


\end{itemize}

\section{Network Properties}

The network includes 427 nodes.  The tree model has 777 edges; the peer model
has 1244.  In both networks, the possible number of edges is constrained due to
the realities of the coaching profession.  It's nearly impossible for a node to
have 0 edges since no coach serves all three roles.  The maximum degree is also
relatively limited due to coaching careers being finite.  It's rare for a head
coach or coordinator to be under 30 or over 70.

The degree distribution for the tree model is calculated as follows and shown in figure \ref{fig:tree-prop}.

<<tree-prop, fig.cap="Cumulative degree distribution for tree model">>=
tree_g = read.graph("coaches_tree.gml",format="gml")
summary(tree_g)

tree_deg = degree.distribution(tree_g, cumulative = TRUE)
plot(tree_deg,log="xy",xlab="degree k",ylab="P(x) >= k",cex=0.5)
@

The degree distribution for the peer model is calculated as follows and shown
in figure \ref{fig:tree-prop}.

<<peer-prop, fig.cap="Cumulative degree distribution for peer model">>=
peer_g = read.graph("coaches_peer.gml",format="gml")
summary(peer_g)

peer_deg = degree.distribution(tree_g, cumulative = TRUE)
plot(peer_deg,log="xy",xlab="degree k",ylab="P(x) >= k",cex=0.5)
@

A Fruchterman-Reingold layout of the tree graph is show in figure
\ref{fig:graph-plot}.  There graph appears tighly clustered in general, without
an obvious community structure.

<<graph-plot,fig.height=6,fig.width=6,fig.cap="Visualization of the tree model">>=
plot.igraph(tree_g, layout=layout.fruchterman.reingold, vertex.label=NA, vertex.size=4)
@

\section{Centrality}

There are several measures of centrality; it's unclear which is most useful for
this network.  This section considers \emph{betweenness}, \emph{closeness},
\emph{page rank}, and \emph{authority}.  The tree model is used in order to
stress the influence of the head coach.

\subsection{Degree}

The simplest centrality measure is degree centrality.  The following snippet
selects the top 20 nodes by degree:

<<tree-deg>>=
td = degree(tree_g)
top = V(tree_g)$label[order(td, decreasing=TRUE)[1:20]]
intersect(top, sb_winners)
@

There are 7 Super Bowl winners in the top 20 nodes by degree centrality.

\subsection{Betweenness}

The first measure of centrality to be evaluated is betweeness, which measures
how many shortest paths traverse the node.  The following snippet calculates
betweenness for all nodes in the tree model and selects the 20 nodes with the
top betweenness.  

<<tree-cent>>=
bb = betweenness(tree_g, v=V(tree_g), directed=TRUE)
top = V(tree_g)$label[order(bb, decreasing=TRUE)[1:20]]
intersect(top, sb_winners)
@

There are 6 super-bowl-winning coaches in the top 20.  Since there are 427
coaches in the graph and 23 Super Bowl winners, this is a promising result.

\subsection{Closeness}

Another measure of centrality is closeness, which represents the distance to
other nodes in the network.  The following snippet applies the closeness
calculation.

<<tree-close>>=
cc = closeness(tree_g, v=V(tree_g), mode="out")
top = V(tree_g)$label[order(cc, decreasing=TRUE)[1:20]]
intersect(top, sb_winners)
@

The result is 4 Super Bowl winners in the top 20, better than chance, but not
as strong as degree.

\subsection{Page Rank}

Page Rank is an algorithm developed at Google for ranking web pages based on
hyperlink structure \cite{pagerank}.  Each page's rank is based on the rank of
the pages that link to it.  This algorithm may help identify successful and
influential coaches in a way that other centrality measures don't.  Page Rank
is calculated in R as follows:

<<tree-rank>>=
pr  = page.rank(tree_g)$vector
top = V(tree_g)$label[order(pr, decreasing=TRUE)[1:20]]
intersect(top, sb_winners)
@

Again we find 6 Super Bowl winners in the top 20, indicating page rank is
reflective of coaching success.

\subsection{Kleinburg Authority/Hub}

Kleinberg's authority score is also based on web page hyperlinks
\cite{authority}.  Like Page Rank, it may be a more accurate centrality measure
that more crude measures.  It is calculated in R as follows:
<<tree-authority>>=
as = authority.score(tree_g)$vector
top = V(tree_g)$label[order(as, decreasing=TRUE)[1:20]]
intersect(top, sb_winners)
@

The top 20 nodes by Kleinberg authority score include only 5 Super Bowl winners.

\section{Community Structure}

In addition to centrality, the community structure of the NFL coaches network
may reflect intuitions around coaching 'families'.  

% cliques
<<cliques>>=
clq = largest.cliques(as.undirected(peer_g))
V(peer_g)$label[clq[[1]]]
@

The largest clique has only 4 members.  A less restrictive definition of community is k-cores:

% k-core
<<kcore>>=
cn = graph.coreness(as.undirected(peer_g))
cn[which.max(cn)]
length(cn[cn == 5])
@

The largest k-core is only 5 nodes, though 116 nodes belong to a 5-core.  It
appears that coaches shuffle enough that it is difficult to identify communities.  This mirrors the appearance of the graph in figure \ref{fig:graph-plot}

\section{Conclusion}

This report analyzed the social network of NFL coaches serving as head coach or
coorindator in the years 1980-2013.  The two primary questions answered were
regarding the alignment of centrality measures with coaching success and the
existence of communities revolving around particular coaching styles and/or
philosophies.

With respect to centrality, this report finds that multiple centrality measures
were well-aligned with coaching success.  In the tree model, the top 20 nodes
by degree centrality contained 7 Super Bowl winning coaches.  In addition, for
both betweenness and page rank, the top 20 vertices contained 6
super-bowl-winning coaches.  This should not be surprising since winning
coaches will tend to have a long career and have their assistants hired away
for other jobs, leading to more edges.  We haven't gained much insight here;
future work should include a full correlation measure between centrality and a
more complete metric like winning percentage, as well as normalizing by career
length.

With respect to communities, the results were less clear.  The visual graph and
the k-core measure did not show a significant presence of communities.  This
part of the analysis might be improved by including more assistant coaches and
characterizing head coaches as offensive or defensive based on their previous
coordinator positions.
